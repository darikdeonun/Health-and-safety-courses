What Are Health and Safety Courses?
Health and safety courses are structured training programs designed to educate individuals and teams on how to prevent accidents, manage risks, and follow legal safety standards. Whether you're an employee, supervisor, or business owner, these courses provide practical knowledge that can be applied in real-life situations.
